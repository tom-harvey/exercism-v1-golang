# Exercism V1 Problems in golang

These are my submissions to the [Exercism](https://exercism.io) V1 golang
track. I think most of these challenges are still in use in the current,
revamped Exercism, so don't peek at them until you've tried the problems on
your own.

It is my sense that in the revamped Exercism, the other learners' code is not
generally available for quick inspection. I thought this V1 feature was
extremely useful because I could quickly survey many other submissions to see
if there was a better way to solve the problem. 

I'm pretty happy with most of my submissions, except for twelve_days.go, where
the attempt to create hyper-efficient strings never got finished.

Many of the exercism v1 problems came with benchmarks, and in most cases I
attempted to create the fastest possible implementation, at the expense of
readability and simplicity, with reverse_string.go being the most extreme
example. This was done with the understanding that premature optimization is
the root of all efficient libraries. Some of the problem files also include a
cleaner, simpler implementation under a slightly different name.
